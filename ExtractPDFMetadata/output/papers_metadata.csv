nihms-1629483.pdf,Sharpening the resolution on data matters: a brief roadmap for understanding deep learning for medical data,Allen  Schmaltz; Andrew L Beam,2022,The Spine Journal,10.1016/j.spinee.2020.08.012,"Statistics has historically been the workhorse for analyzing clinical trials, building prediction models, and analyzing most types of medical data. However, recently large amounts of available healthcare data and increasing computing power have enabled techniques from the field of machine learning to play an ever larger role in clinical applications. The fields of machine learning and statistics in fact have many things in common, but they can appear at first glance to be quite different given the way each community describes its goals and techniques (Beam and Kohane 2018). This false sense of difference is further heightened because much of the recent work in machine learning has been described under the umbrella term of ""artificial intelligence"" (AI). It should be noted that AI refers to a goal (i.e. computers that behave ""intelligently"") and does not in itself describe a method to achieve that goal. Much of the recent and rapid progress towards the goal of medical AI has been enabled by advancements in the subfield of machine learning known as deep learning (LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015;Hinton 2018;Schmidhuber 2015). However, beyond the AI hyperbole, the successes afforded by the use of deep learning to date have been more modest and narrow in high-risk settings, such as medicine, but are nonetheless likely to expand in coming years (Topol 2019; Ghassemi et al. 2018), though many challenges remain (Beam, Manrai, and Ghassemi 2020). The relevant literature stretches multiple decades and is rapidly growing, and we provide here a high-level overview of deep learning, with an emphasis on medical applications and natural language data. We offer a key insight for applications of deep learning in medicine, a dichotomy that presents both challenges and opportunities for real-world applications: Deep learning models can amplify biases and other issues in the underlying data, but those same models can be leveraged to uncover data issues and patterns that might not be readily discoverable via more parsimonious models."

These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine."

It relies on the assumption that average treatment effects from the trial can be extrapolated to patients with personal and/or disease characteristics different from those treated in the trial. Yet, because of heterogeneity of treatment effects between patients and between the trial population and real-world patients, this assumption may not be correct for many patients. Using machine learning to estimate the expected conditional average treatment effect (CATE) in individual patients from observational data offers the potential for more accurate estimation of the expected treatment effects in each patient based on their observed characteristics.

Vinks 2 Machine learning is now being introduced in medicine, with the idea that the vast multidimensional clinical data and experiences documented in electronic health records can assist in the care of future patients. 1 The ability of a machine learning model to find statistical patterns across millions of features and examples is what enables superhuman performance. 2 By mining the complex and heterogeneous data from electronic health records (referred to as ""big data""), patients can benefit from previous collective experience leading to improvements in diagnostic procedures, outcome predictions, and individualized treatments. Also in laboratory medicine, artificial intelligence and machine learning are finding their application. 3 To date, population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models have been used to describe drug exposure over time in patients. With popPK models it is also possible to identify sources of between-patient variability in drug exposure such as body weight and renal function. During the modeling process, models with different numbers of compartments, types of elimination, and variability are evaluated. 4 When a model has been designed that adequately describes the data, it can prospectively be used to guide drug dosing in an individual patient with the aim to achieve prespecified target concentrations with maximum precision and accuracy. 5 At present this is largely done with stand-alone software packages for PK-guided dosing that are commercially or freely available, but it is expected that such tools will become more integrated into the electronic health records. 6 In 2005 an online system for Immunosuppressant Bayesian Dose Adjustment (ISBA) was launched by the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire at Limoges, France. 7 This service was made available at no cost to transplantation centers worldwide. 8 The investigators developed and validated popPK models, maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimators, and sparse sampling strategies for abbreviated area under the curve (AUC) estimation to generate individual PK parameters for immunosuppressive drugs for a variety of solid organ transplantation scenarios. 9 This now widely used service provides recommendations for dose adjustment for individual transplanted patients, based on drug concentrations (preferably several samples within the first few hours post dose) uploaded via a secure portal and reported back to the requesting center. In the background, 145 Bayesian estimators are operational for the different posttransplantation times, ages (adult/pediatric), types of transplantation, associated immunosuppressive drugs, and drug measurement methods (Pierre Marquet, personal communication)."

Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-toend learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human interpretability."
example_file.pdf,Attention Is All You Need,Ashish  Vaswani; Google  Brain; Noam  Shazeer; Niki  Parmar; Jakob  Uszkoreit; Llion  Jones; Aidan N Gomez; Łukasz  Kaiser,,,,"The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data."

Being able to automatically extract relevant features needed for a given task from high-dimensional, heterogeneous data, deep learning (DL) holds great promise in this endeavour. This review paper addresses the main developments of DL algorithms and a set of general topics where DL is decisive, namely, within the SM landscape. It discusses how DL can be applied to SM with an emphasis on the applications to predictive, preventive and precision medicine. Several key challenges have been highlighted including delivering clinical impact and improving interpretability. We used some prototypical examples to highlight the relevance and significance of the adoption of DL in SM, one of them is involving the creation of a model for personalized Parkinson's disease. The review offers valuable insights and informs the research in DL and SM."
